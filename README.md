# Dynamic Camera
Beat Saber plugin based on the original CameraPlus.  
While in 3rd person, the camera will automatically avoid the incoming walls in order to keep the player/avatar in sight.

!! Please keep in mind that this is a replacement for the CameraPlus plugin!  
!! It will not work with both plugins installed! 

### Watch it in action [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0fMcUkKPFE)!

Use the [mod installer](https://github.com/Umbranoxio/BeatSaberModInstaller/releases)

Press <kbd>F1</kbd> to toggle between first and third person.

After you run the game once, a `DynamicCamera.cfg` file is created within the Beat Saber folder.  
Edit that file to configure the plugin:
* **3rdPersonCameraDistance** - how far back the camera should be from the avatar/player  
* **3rdPersonCameraUpperHeight, 3rdPersonCameraLowerHeight, 3rdPersonCameraLateralNear, 3rdPersonCameraLateralFar** - used to define the 8 possible camera positions  
* **3rdPersonCameraForwardPrediction** - this value is used to predict the walls (bigger value = looks for the walls further)  
* **3rdPersonCameraSpeed** - how fast the camera will move from one point to another
